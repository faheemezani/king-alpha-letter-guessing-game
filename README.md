# King Alpha's Letter Guessing Game
![King Alpha's Letter-Guessing Game screenshot](/images/screenshot.PNG)

This was a Visual Basic based programming project which was developed during my studies at the Matriculation of IIUM (year 2002). **Mohd Zaidi Sulaiman** was my project partner. I happened to stumble into this in one of my backup CDs. Seems to run well on my current Windows 10. 

This assignment was done under the purview of the then [**Madam Maznah Bt Ahmad**](http://www.iium.edu.my/my/staff/show/771) (now, an Assistant Professor at the International Islamic University Malaysia). May Allah bless her efforts and commitment.

## How to Install the Game
1. Download both the **H571377** folder and the **King Alpha** application file in the same directory on your Windows.
1. Double click on the **King Alpha** file to launch the game.
