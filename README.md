This was a Visual Basic based programming project which was developed during my time at Matriculation of IIUM (year 2002). Mohd Zaidi Sulaiman was my project partner. I happened to stumble into this in one of my backup CDs. Seems to run well on my current Windows 10.

## How to Install the Game
1. Download both the **H571377** folder and the **King Alpha** application file in the same directory on your Windows.
1. Double click on the **King Alpha** file to launch the game.
